                                      car battery is the most important
                                      component in any vehicle’s electrical
                                      system. It provides of energy to power the
                                      car lights, accessories, and engine. Once
                                      the battery jolts the engine to life, the
                                      alternator takes over and continues the
                                      power transmission.

                                      If your car battery is dead, your vehicle
                                      won’t start, and the alternator will have
                                      to work too hard — potentially to the
                                      point of failure — which is why it's so
                                      important to take care of the battery.

                                      The fluid in your lead-acid battery is
                                      called electrolyte. It's actually a
                                      mixture of sulphuric acid and water. When
                                      your battery charges, the electrolyte
                                      heats up and some of the water evaporates.
                                      Gassing causes water loss, which is why
                                      lead acid batteries need to have water
                                      added periodically. Low maintenance
                                      batteries like AGM batteries, are the
                                      exception because they have the ability to
                                      compensate for water loss. Overwatering
                                      and under watering can both damage your

                                        For best battery life, batteries should
                                        not be discharged below 80% of their
                                        rated capacity. Proper battery sizing
                                        will help avoid excessive discharge.

                                        Periodic battery testing is an important
                                        preventative maintenance procedure.
                                        Hydrometer readings of each cell (fully
                                        charged) gives an indication of balance
                                        and true charge level. Imbalance could
                                        mean the need for equalizing; is often a
                                        sign of improper charging or a bad cell.
                                        Voltage checks (open circuit, charged
                                        and discharged) can locate a bad battery
                                        or weak battery. Load testing will pick
                                        out a bad battery when other methods
                                        fail. A weak battery will cause
                                        premature failure of companion
                                        batteries.

                                        Always use a matched charger and battery
                                        pack system. Unmatched chargers will
                                        cause potential problems.

                                        As batteries age, their maintenance
                                        requirements change. This means longer
                                        charging time and/or higher finish rate
                                        (higher amperage at the end of the
                                        charge). Usually older batteries need to
                                        be watered more often…and their capacity
                                        decreases.

                                        Lead acid batteries should be brought up
                                        to full charge at the earliest
                                        opportunity. Avoid continuously
                                        operating batteries in a partially
                                        charged condition. This will shorten
                                        their life and reduce their capacity.

                                        Extreme temperatures can substantially
                                        affect battery performance and charging.
                                        Cold reduces battery capacity and
                                        retards charging. Heat increases water
                                        usage and can result in overcharging.
                                        Very high temperatures can cause
                                        “thermal run-away” which may lead to an
                                        explosion. If extreme temperature is an
                                        unavoidable part of an application,
                                        consult a battery/charger specialist
                                        about ways to deal with the problem.

                                      preference, you can call our customer

                                      not currently in stock, we can order those
                                      for you, although that may delay your
