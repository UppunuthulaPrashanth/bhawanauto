                                    A pre-purchase inspection is a detailed

                                    performed by a certified technician who is
                                    knowledgeable in the make and model of the
                                    vehicle being inspected. The intent of the
                                    PPI is to uncover existing conditions or to
                                    reveal maintenance shortcomings that may
