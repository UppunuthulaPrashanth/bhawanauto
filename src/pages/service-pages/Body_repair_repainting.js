                                    car, even before a breakdown. The
                                    computerized Diagnostic tool scans your

                                    get them fixed before they turn into bigger
                                    and more expensive issues. When your car has

                                    the dashboard. If the light goes out the
                                    system will store the fault code so the
                                    garage will find this when they do the
